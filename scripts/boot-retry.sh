# Bring the server up through box64's flaky boot: restart, watch, and if it truly hangs,
# restart and try again. box64 boots succeed maybe 30-50% of the time on their own, so a
# few automated retries is the fast way to get to "listening".
#
#   success = UDP :16261 is listening
#   hang    = console silent >2 min AND CPU idle over 8s   -> restart & retry
#   a box64 JIT SIGSEGV is FLAKY, so `Restart=always` reboots it and we keep trying.
#   Only a failed Workshop download (onItemNotDownloaded) is deterministic -> STOP (recrashes).
#
# Installed as /usr/local/sbin/pz-boot-retry ; also invoked by `pzctl` (menu: Start / Bring up).
